# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

Robin has asked us to help adjust her current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. By using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, we can scrape full-resolution images and titles of Mars's hemispheres. We'll use Mongo database to store scraped data, use a web application to display the data, and then redesign the web application in order for the images to show up neatly.
